# CS370_Final - Pirate Intelligent Agent â€“ Portfolio Reflection

## What work did I do on this project?

For this project, I implemented a reinforcement learning model to train an intelligent pirate agent to navigate a maze and locate hidden treasure. The starter code provided the foundational environment setup, including the maze structure and helper classes for simulation. I developed the Deep Q-Learning (DQN) training function, which integrates neural networks, experience replay, and a target network to improve stability and convergence. My implementation included reward shaping, epsilon decay for exploration-exploitation balance, and adaptive model updates to ensure the agent achieved near-perfect success within 1000 epochs.

## Connecting my learning to the field of computer science

Computer scientists design and implement systems that solve real-world problems through computation, logic, and data-driven decision-making. This project reflects a core aspect of computer science: building intelligent systems that can learn from experience. Reinforcement learning, a subfield of AI, demonstrates how computer scientists model human-like learning behaviors using algorithms and feedback loops. By applying concepts like neural networks, backpropagation, and policy optimization, I contributed to the broader goal of creating adaptive, autonomous agents that can generalize solutions across environments.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach problems systematically by breaking them down into smaller, testable components, defining clear success metrics, and iteratively improving the solution through experimentation. For this project, I first ensured the environment and reward system worked correctly, then optimized the learning algorithm for faster convergence. I used both quantitative metrics (win rate, loss reduction) and qualitative reasoning (agent behavior observation) to guide refinements. This structured, evidence-based process is central to how computer scientists design and validate solutions efficiently.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization?

As a computer scientist, I have an ethical duty to create systems that are transparent, reliable, and beneficial to users and society. In artificial intelligence projects, this means ensuring models do not reinforce bias, behave unpredictably, or operate without human oversight. Ethically, I must prioritize user safety, data privacy, and fairness in every stage of development. Within an organization, I also have a responsibility to maintain code integrity, document decisions clearly, and consider the broader societal implications of deploying intelligent systems.
